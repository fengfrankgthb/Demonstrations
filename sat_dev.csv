When companies in the same industry propose merging 
with one another, they often claim that the merger will 
benefit consumers by increasing efficiency and therefore 
lowering prices. Economist Ying Fan investigated this 
notion in the context of the United States newspaper 
market. She modeled a hypothetical merger of 
Minneapolis-area newspapers and found that subscription 
prices would rise following a merger. 
Text 2 
Economists Daria Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have argued 
that research on the effect of mergers on prices has 
focused excessively on short-term effects, which tend to be 
adverse for consumers. Using the case of consumer 
banking in Italy, they show that over the long term (several 
years, in their study), the efficiency gains realized by 
merged companies do result in economic benefits for 
consumers."

food, but they are difficult to digest in part because of their 
high levels of soluble filler and compounds like raffinose. 
They also contain antinutrients like tannins and trypsin

extract nutrients from foods. In a research article, 
Marisela Granito and Glenda Alvarez from Simon Bolivar 
University in Venezuela claim that inducing fermentation 
of black beans using lactic acid bacteria improves the

Conventional wisdom long held that human social 
systems evolved in stages, beginning with huntergatherers forming small bands of members with roughly 
equal status. The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years 
ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence 
of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of 
clans first, then chiefdoms, and finally, bureaucratic 
states.              Text 2     In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans 
have always been socially flexible, alternately forming 
systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with 
decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence 
that as far back as 50,000 years ago some hunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into 
communities that included esteemed individuals. "

were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the 
Vancouver Island meacows have a more diverse gene
