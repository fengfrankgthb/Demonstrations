        "2. The LIT widget will appear. You should see your \"sst_tiny\" model and the \"manual_input_data\" dataset (which will be empty).\n",
        "3. In the LIT interface, look for a section like \"Datapoint Editor\" or \"Data Table\".\n",
        "4. There should be an option to \"Create new datapoint\" or an \"Add\" button.\n",
        "5. Click it. Input fields corresponding to your model's input (e.g., a field labeled \"sentence\") will appear.\n",
        "6. Type or paste your sentence into the appropriate field.\n",
        "7. Click \"Analyze\" or \"Add datapoint\". LIT will send this sentence to the model.\n",
        "8. The model's predictions and interpretations for that sentence will then be displayed in the various LIT modules (like \"Predictions\", \"Salience Maps\", etc.).\n",
        "9. You can repeat this process to add and analyze 10-20 sentences, or as many as you need. Each sentence you add will appear in the \"Data Table\".\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Notes**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Model Path**: The `SST2Model('./')` assumes that the `sst2_tiny.tar.gz` file extracts its contents (like `vocab.txt`, `sst2_tiny.tflite`, etc.) directly into the current working directory or a subdirectory structure that `SST2Model` expects relative to './'. If `tar -xvf sst2_tiny.tar.gz` creates a directory (e.g., `sst2_tiny/`), you might need to change the path to models.`SST2Model('./sst2_tiny/')`. You can check what files are created after the !tar command to be sure.\n",
        "* **Input Field Name**: The `SST2Model` expects the input text under a specific feature name (usually `\"sentence\"`). When you add a new datapoint in the UI, ensure you're typing into the field with that name. The `model.input_spec()` ensures the dataset is set up correctly for this.\n",
        "* **Widget Port**: If port `8890` is in use, you can change it to another available port.\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup should allow you to start with an empty slate and interactively build up a small dataset for analysis directly within the LIT interface."
